Download files for High, medium, Low density cases for Microcliamte Digital Platform tutorial

This DAE file contains 3D models representing both low-rise and high-rise HDB (Housing and Development Board) buildings in Singapore. The low-rise HDB model illustrates typical walk-up block designs with fewer stories, while the high-rise HDB model captures the modern, multi-storey apartment blocks commonly found in high-density urban estates. These models serve as digital representations for architectural visualization, urban planning, and environmental simulation studies, making them useful for microclimate analysis, educational workshops, or design presentations.

[UCDL Microclimate Digital Platform](https://mdp.ucdl.sg/)

The UCDL Microclimate Digital Platform (MDP) is an open-access web-based tool for visualizing and modeling urban microclimate simulations, designed to support climate-sensitive urban planning in Singapore and beyond. It integrates real-time measurements (such as air temperature, wind speed, humidity, and solar radiation) and offers multi-scale tools for assessing urban heat island effects, wind permeability, and pollutant dispersion. This platform is widely used for academic research, planning, and training by universities, government agencies, and industry professionals, and features user-generated model uploads and interactive analysis capabilities.
