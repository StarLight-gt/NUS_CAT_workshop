Download files for High, medium, Low density cases for Microcliamte Digital Platform tutorial

Here is a suitable description for the README file:

This DAE file contains 3D models representing both low-rise and high-rise HDB (Housing and Development Board) buildings in Singapore. The low-rise HDB model illustrates typical walk-up block designs with fewer stories, while the high-rise HDB model captures the modern, multi-storey apartment blocks commonly found in high-density urban estates. These models serve as digital representations for architectural visualization, urban planning, and environmental simulation studies, making them useful for microclimate analysis, educational workshops, or design presentations.
